Build a modern, futuristic, robotic-themed portfolio website for Harshit Manik, an aspiring entrepreneur and cutting-edge innovator in Agentic AI, IoT, AR/VR, and Edge AI analytics. The site should feature a sleek, high-tech look, with a cool-toned palette (blues, greys, cyber-black), subtle animations, and metallic UI elements to reflect Harshit’s deep tech expertise and forward-thinking approach. A circular profile picture with a techy glow effect should be placed prominently on the homepage.

Site Structure:
Home

Hero section with animated background (like a circuit board or low-opacity AI wireframe mesh).

Profile picture of Harshit with a short intro:
"Hi, I'm Harshit Manik — a builder at heart, passionate about Agentic AI, real-time IoT systems, and futuristic automation. I build, deploy, and scale ideas that push the edge of intelligent systems."
