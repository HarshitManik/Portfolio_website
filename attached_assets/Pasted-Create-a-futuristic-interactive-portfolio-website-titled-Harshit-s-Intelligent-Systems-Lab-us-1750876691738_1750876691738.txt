🧠 About Harshit:
- AI/IoT/Embedded Systems Engineer
- Worked with Agentic AI (multi-agent decision systems with Quartz optimization expert, drone image classifiers, and sensor-triggered actions)
- Built a non-invasive glucose monitoring system (RF S-parameters + ML)
- Designed predictive analytics tools for solar cleaning drones and threat classification using CNN + acoustic STFT
- Skills include: TensorFlow, Flask, MQTT, Raspberry Pi, Vuforia, Unity, React, Tailwind, Three.js

📦 Project Requirements:

1. **Hero Section**
   - Fullscreen 3D background (particles or rotating rings) using Three.js
   - Animated title: “Harshit’s Intelligent Systems Lab”
   - Subtitles rotating: “AI Researcher | IoT Developer | AR/VR Explorer | Startup Builder”
   - Call-to-action button: “Explore My Agents”
   - Light/dark mode toggle stored in localStorage

2. **Agentic Sectional Navigation**
   - Each section has a virtual "agent" that briefly introduces it (e.g., SystemSynth for Projects, TechTagger for Skills)
   - Use Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions for animations

3. **Projects Section**
   - Use graph layout or visual tiles to show interlinked components: sensors → Pi → ML model → output
   - Each project opens a modal or 3D detail card with tech stack, results, GitHub/demo links
   - Showcase: Glucose Monitoring, Acoustic Threat Detection, Aeroinspect-Solar, Predictive Drone AI

4. **Skills Section**
   - 3D rotating tag cloud using `@react-three/fiber` and `drei`
   - Tooltip-style explanations when hovering

5. **Experience Section**
   - Timeline of key roles: IIT Roorkee intern, Thapar Research, Aeroinspect-Solar Founder
   - Use icons/logos, animated scroll transitions

6. **Publications/Patents**
   - Flip cards or reveal tiles
   - Show patent badge where applicable

7. **Contact**
   - Glassmorphism email form using EmailJS
   - Fields: Name, Email, Message
   - On success: confetti animation
   - Social media links: GitHub, LinkedIn

---

🎨 UI Design:
- Minimal, sci-fi lab vibe
- Color palette: deep blues, tech purples, grayscale
- Use modern sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Sora)
- Floating navbar with scroll tracking

---

🛠️ Tech & Config:
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Three.js or @react-three/fiber
- Framer Motion
- EmailJS integration
- Firebase-ready structure with `firebase.json` and `.env` setup
- Light/dark theme persisted via localStorage
- Build with performance in mind: code-split, lazy-load assets, tree-shake, and compress

---

📄 Output:
- Fully working code scaffolded in Replit
- All components modularized (`src/components`)
- Use file naming like: `Hero.jsx`, `Projects.jsx`, `AgentBio.jsx`, `Skills3D.jsx`, `ContactForm.jsx`
- README should include build steps, env setup, Firebase hosting instructions
